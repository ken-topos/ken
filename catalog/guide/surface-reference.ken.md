# Surface reference — the practical shape of Ken

How to actually write the pieces of a Ken program: the purity keywords,
`data`/`match`, refinement types, `class`/`instance`, effect rows, and this
guide's own literate `.ken.md` format. This strand is task-first ("how do I
write X") — for the exhaustive grammar and the normative contract, see
`../../spec/30-surface/`, chapter-linked throughout.

Every ` ```ken example ` block below elaborates against the real toolchain
(`ken run` over this file); every ` ```ken reject ` block is checked to
actually fail. Nothing here is aspirational syntax — where the spec allows a
form that no landed catalog code actually uses (implicit `{A : Type}`
parameters, most visibly), this strand says so and shows the form that is
actually in use instead.

## 1. Purity keywords: `const`/`fn`/`proc`

A definition's keyword **declares its static purity** — checked against both
the signature and the body, not a comment
(`spec/30-surface/33-declarations.md §1`):

- **`const`** — a pure value, zero explicit value parameters.
- **`fn`** — a pure function, one or more explicit value parameters.
- **`proc … visits ρ`** — potentially impure/imperative; the *only* keyword
  that may carry an effect row (§6).

All three keywords in one runnable block. A literate entry's compiled fences
tangle into one module, and `ken run` executes its named `main` — so this
block, being runnable, ends in an ABI-shaped `proc main` (§9 covers why a
catalog *package* entry, a library rather than a runnable file, carries none):

```ken
program capabilities FS APartial

data Color = Red | Green | Blue

const favorite : Color = Blue

fn is_red (c : Color) : Bool =
  match c {
    Red ↦ True;
    Green ↦ False;
    Blue ↦ False
  }

proc announce (c : Color) : IO Unit visits [Console] =
  match c {
    Red ↦ print_line "it's red";
    Green ↦ print_line "it's green";
    Blue ↦ print_line "it's blue"
  }

proc main
      (_input : ProcessInput) (_caps : ProgramCaps APartial)
    : HostIO APartial ExitCode
    visits [Console] =
  host_program APartial (announce favorite)
```

**Every landed catalog type parameter is explicit**, `(a : Type)`, never the
spec's proposed implicit `{A : Type}` form — grep `catalog/packages/` and
every generic `fn`/`const`/`class` binds its type parameter as an ordinary
leading `(a : Type)` argument that the caller supplies at every call site
(see `map.ken`'s `insert (k : Type) (v : Type) (leq : …) …`). Write new
catalog code the same way: explicit type parameters, applied positionally.

The purity check is real, not advisory — an `fn` that performs an effect is
rejected, and a `proc` declared with no row that performs one is rejected
(§6 has the row-omission case). Here, `print_line` needs `[Console]`, and
`fn` carries no row at all:

```ken reject
fn announce_wrong (c : Color) : IO Unit = print_line "not allowed in fn"
```

## 2. `def`: transparent definitions

`def T … = …` is a **definition**: a base type narrowed by conditions (a
refinement/`Σ`/Π-type abbreviation), or the zero-condition case — a plain
alias (`spec/30-surface/33-declarations.md §1`). `def` was spelled `type`
before `SURF-def-refinement`; `type` is now reserved, not a declaration
keyword.

The load-bearing surface fact is that `def` is **transparent** — it unfolds
by δ, so a value at the defined name is interchangeable with a value at its
underlying type, no wrap/unwrap step required. This is exactly the property
that makes `def` the right tool for a refinement alias (`{n : Int | …}`
named once, reused everywhere `PosInt` appears) instead of a `data`
wrapper: a `def`-refined value is, at the kernel, still just the underlying
type's value.

`five` below is usable directly wherever an `Int` is expected — `def` never
introduces a boundary the way an inductive `data` former does:

```ken example
def PosInt = {n : Int | Equal Bool (leq_int 0 n) True}

const five : PosInt = 5

fn add_to_pos_int (n : Int) (p : PosInt) : Int = add_int n p

const ten : Int = add_to_pos_int five five
```

A plain, zero-condition `def` is just a name for an existing type — still
transparent, so it changes nothing about how the underlying values behave:

```ken example
def Age = Int

const my_age : Age = 30

fn add_years (n : Int) (a : Age) : Int = add_int n a

const later : Int = add_years 5 my_age
```

Contrast this with `data` (§3): an inductive type former **never**
δ-unfolds, so a `data`-wrapped value is a genuinely different, opaque type
that must be pattern-matched apart before its payload is usable —
`def`'s transparency is the exception, not the default. `Box` below is a
`data` type — opaque, never δ-unfolds — so unlike the `def Age` case above, a
`Box` value is NOT usable where a plain `Int` is expected, even though it is
"just an Int" underneath:

```ken reject
data Box = MkBox Int

fn add_years_wrong (n : Int) (b : Box) : Int = add_int n b
```

## 3. `data` and `match`

`data` declares a genuine inductive type: real constructors, a real
generated eliminator, and `match` compiles to that eliminator with a
**checked exhaustiveness** requirement
(`spec/30-surface/34-data-match.md §1, §4`). Every constructor must be
covered — but a final `_`/variable arm is the sanctioned way to cover the
remaining constructors (`34 §4.1`, `§4.2`); there is no way to *skip* a
case, not a ban on wildcards.

```ken example
data Shape = Circle Int | Rectangle Int Int

fn area (s : Shape) : Int =
  match s {
    Circle r ↦ mul_int r r;
    Rectangle w h ↦ mul_int w h
  }
```

A `match` missing a constructor is a hard elaboration error, not a runtime
possibility — the surface catches it before the kernel ever sees the term.
Below, `Caution` and `Go` are left unhandled, so it rejects as non-exhaustive:

```ken reject
data TrafficLight = Stop | Caution | Go

fn is_stop (t : TrafficLight) : Bool =
  match t {
    Stop ↦ True
  }
```

`Option`/`Result` are ordinary `data` declarations built the same way — no
special-cased sum type:

```ken example
fn safe_head (a : Type) (xs : List a) : Option a =
  match xs {
    Nil ↦ None a;
    Cons x _ ↦ Some a x
  }
```

## 4. Refinement types

`{ x : A | φ }` is the type of `x : A` for which `φ x` holds. It elaborates
to `A` plus an emitted proof obligation, never a new kernel type former
(`spec/30-surface/34-data-match.md §5`) — a refined value is, at runtime,
just an `A`. This is the mechanism a `fn`'s return type uses to state a real
postcondition instead of describing it only in a comment. Below, the
refinement is the postcondition: `abs_int` really does return a non-negative
Int, and `leq_int 0 y` is the same `Bool`-valued comparator the
lawful-classes package builds `Ord` on top of:

```ken example
fn abs_int (x : Int) : {y : Int | Equal Bool (leq_int 0 y) True} =
  match leq_int 0 x {
    True ↦ x;
    False ↦ sub_int 0 x
  }
```

A refinement can conjoin more than one property with the prelude's `And`
(real landed idiom — `conformance/challenge/C5-verified-sort` proves a
`sort` this way: the result is a `List a` that is *both* sorted *and* a
permutation of the input, in one refinement). A function parameter can be
refined too, the mirror case of a refined result — a refined PARAMETER, here
accepting only Booleans equal to `True`, the same shape
`catalog/packages/Data/Collections/Collections.ken`'s `true_refinement_project`
uses:

```ken example
fn project_true (x : {b : Bool | Equal Bool b True}) : Bool = x
```

## 5. `class` and `instance`

A `class` is an ordinary record of operations (and, when the class states
laws, of proof obligations); `instance` is an ordinary record value — no new
kernel feature, a `class` is a right-nested `Σ` exactly like `record`
(`spec/50-stdlib/51-lawful-classes.md`, and every `lawful-classes`/
`lawful-functors` package instance). Reach for a `class` only when you
genuinely need dispatch on a type; if there is exactly one carrier, an
explicit dictionary or a bare top-level `fn` is simpler and equally lawful
(the decomposition strand's §1 covers the choice).

```ken example
class Describe a {
  describe : a → String
}

instance Describe Bool {
  describe = λb.match b {
    True ↦ "true";
    False ↦ "false"
  }
}

fn announce_it (b : Bool) : String = (Describe_instance_Bool).describe b
```

**Referencing an instance as a value outside a `where`-resolved call** is
the synthesized global `Describe_instance_Bool` above — not `(Describe
Bool)`, which is the class **applied to its head**, i.e. the dictionary's
*type*, not a value, so projecting a field off it fails immediately:

```ken reject
const wrong : String = (Describe Bool).describe True
```

A class field's own type may itself carry a law — the shape every entry in
`catalog/packages/Core/` follows, covered in depth by the proof techniques
strand. `Eq` below elides `sym`/`trans` for brevity; see
`catalog/packages/Core/LawfulClasses.ken` for the full class:

```ken ignore
class Eq a {
  eq : a → a → Bool;
  refl : (x : a) → IsTrue (eq x x)
}
```

## 6. Effect rows (`visits`)

A `proc`'s effect row is part of its type: `visits [E₁, …]` names exactly
the effects its body may perform, **statically checked and transitively
inferred** — a call to an effectful function requires its effects to already
be in the caller's own row (`spec/30-surface/36-effects.md §1`).

```ken example
proc greet (name : String) : IO Unit visits [Console] = print_line name
```

Omitting a used effect from the row is rejected the same way an exhaustive
match omission is — the checker infers the body's real effects and compares.
Below, the body performs Console but the declared row is empty:

```ken reject
proc silent_greet (name : String) : IO Unit = print_line name
```

A row-polymorphic function keeps a helper's effect abstract instead of
committing it to one concrete row — write `[e]` as the row parameter
(`36 §1.5.1`'s row-variable form) when the helper's own effect should be
whatever its caller's effect happens to be, rather than hard-coding
`[Console]` into something that has nothing to do with the console.

## 7. Named proof claims: `prop`, `lemma`, `proof`

Three more declaration keywords name a proof at the surface, on top of the
`Equal`/`IsTrue` goals §4's refinement obligations already build (`33 §8`).
None of them add a new kernel declaration class or a trusted proof table —
they are elaboration vocabulary over ordinary checked terms:

- **`prop`** names a proposition family — a telescope ending in `Omega`
  (§8.1).
- **`proof <name> for <subject>`** names a checked proof term attached to an
  already-resolved subject (§8.2).
- **`lemma`** names a standalone, reusable checked theorem in the ordinary
  module namespace (§8.3).

A `prop` may carry an optional `where` block of constructor-style intro
helpers. As landed today, the elaborator only accepts a **v0 "Omega-clean
seed shape"**: every intro's conclusion must reapply the family to exactly
its own bound parameters, in order — it cannot introduce extra premises or
construct a new argument value (a real inductive relation like "list
append" needs that). Know this going in: a `where` block is not yet a
general way to define an inductive relation; for that, state the property
as a `lemma`'s result type instead (the proof-techniques strand's induction
and motive-construction section covers this) and prove it directly.

Below, `triv`'s conclusion reapplies `Trivial` to exactly its own parameters
`a` and `x` — inside the v0 seed shape — and the intro helper is addressed
through the family name, `Family.introName`:

```ken example
prop Trivial (a : Type) (x : a) : Ω where {
  triv : Trivial a x
}

const sample_int : Int = 42

lemma trivial_sample : Trivial Int sample_int = Trivial.triv Int sample_int
```

Outside the seed shape: below, `nil`'s conclusion applies `AppendsTo` to
`Nil a` and `ys`/`ys` — not to `AppendsTo`'s own three bound parameters in
order — so this rejects with `"prop intro 'nil' is outside the v0
Omega-clean seed shape"`, not a generic syntax error:

```ken reject
prop AppendsTo (a : Type) (xs : List a) (ys : List a) (zs : List a) : Ω where {
  nil : AppendsTo a (Nil a) ys ys
}
```

`proof <name> for <subject>` attaches a checked proof to a subject that is
already resolved. The subject must occur applied somewhere in the claim, in a
hypothesis or conclusion; attachment records membership, not a required
telescope shape. The canonical path to use it is `subject::proof_name`:

```ken example
fn double_it (x : Int) : Int = add_int x x

proof trivial for double_it (x : Int) : Trivial Int (double_it x) =
  Trivial.triv Int (double_it x)

lemma attached_sample : Trivial Int (double_it sample_int) = double_it::trivial sample_int
```

`lemma` is the standalone form — parameterized like a function, instantiated
by ordinary application, no attachment to a subject:

```ken example
lemma trivial_any (a : Type) (x : a) : Trivial a x = Trivial.triv a x

lemma lemma_sample : Trivial Int sample_int = trivial_any Int sample_int
```

**A `lemma` or attached `proof` may recurse, including mutual recursion with
other proof declarations, only when the shared size-change termination gate
accepts the proof component** (`33 §8.3–8.4`). A recursive proof component is
signatures-first, kernel-checked, and committed only after SCT accepts; a
non-decreasing proof loop fails closed. A recursive cycle that mixes a proof
declaration with a computational `const`/`fn` is rejected in this round.

Below, recursion is structurally descending on `ys`, so the recursive `lemma`
is admitted. The second lemma is an optional non-recursive wrapper showing
ordinary reuse, not a workaround required by the surface:

```ken example
lemma trivial_by_list (a : Type) (x : a) (b : Type) (ys : List b) : Trivial a x =
  match ys {
    Nil ↦ Trivial.triv a x;
    Cons _ t ↦ trivial_by_list a x b t
  }

lemma trivial_by_list_lemma (a : Type) (x : a) (b : Type) (ys : List b) : Trivial a x =
  trivial_by_list a x b ys
```

### 7.1 Choosing a form — the authoring convention

Writing a source top-down (state the result, prove it below) means reaching
for the right keyword line by line. The rule of thumb:

| You are writing…                                        | Reach for          | Classifies at   |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| a type abbreviation / refinement / `Σ`/`Π` shorthand    | `def` (§2)         | — (type-level)  |
| the *statement* of a proposition family to reason about | `prop`             | `Omega`         |
| a reusable, module-level checked theorem                | `lemma`            | `Omega`         |
| a checked proof that belongs to one subject             | `proof … for`      | `Omega`         |
| a value or computation (incl. a proof-relevant witness) | `const`/`fn` (§1)  | `Type`          |
| a goal to hand the prover, no inline proof              | `prove` (`21 §3`)  | `Omega`         |

**The load-bearing rule: `lemma` and `proof` require an `Omega` statement.**
Their elaboration checks that the stated `φ` classifies at `Omega`
(proof-irrelevant); a term whose type lands in `Type` is rejected there, not
silently accepted. So the choice between `lemma`/`proof` and `const`/`fn` is
not stylistic — it follows the `Omega`/`Type` line:

- **`Equal`-typed and `IsTrue`-typed statements are `Omega`** (`Equal : Π(A :
  Type). A → A → Omega`; `IsTrue b` unfolds to `Equal Bool b True`), and so is
  an `And` of two `Omega`s. These are the bread-and-butter law statements —
  refl/antisym/trans/totality, reduction equations — and each goes in a
  `lemma` or `proof` cleanly.
- **Proof-*relevant* conclusions classify at `Type`** — `Or a b` (`Or : Omega
  → Omega → Type`), a `Σ` with a `Type` component, and the disjunction- or
  eliminator-helper terms that carry a chosen branch *as data*. These are
  genuine computation, so they stay `const`/`fn`. Promoting one to a `lemma`
  is not fighting a bug — it is landing on the wrong side of the
  proof-irrelevance boundary; `ensure_omega_type` is doing its job.

In one line: `lemma`/`proof` = irrelevant propositions you *prove*;
`const`/`fn` = data you *compute*. The vocabulary tracks the `Omega`/`Type`
line on purpose.

**`lemma` vs `proof … for <subject>`.** Same checked-theorem elaboration; the
difference is *ownership*. A `lemma` lives in the ordinary module namespace
and is applied by name. A `proof p for s` is exported only as `s::p`, its
telescope follows the theorem being stated, and its claim must mention `s`
applied. Same-subject attached proofs are ordinary dependencies: an acyclic
sibling reference resolves in dependency order, and a recursive sibling group
is admitted only when SCT accepts it.
Reach for `proof … for` when the fact is *about* one definition and should
travel with it; reach for `lemma` when it is a reusable stepping-stone in its
own right.

**Declaration order is dependency-driven, with recursive groups checked
together —
lede-first reads come from the prose, not the code order.** The elaborator
forms a call graph and processes strongly connected components in dependency
order (`33 §1`, §8.4), so an acyclic dependency may appear later in source and a
recursive component is checked signatures-first. Recursive `const`/`fn` groups
and recursive `lemma`/`proof` groups are SCT-gated; mixed computational/proof
cycles reject. Prose should still introduce the result before the code when
that gives the reader a clearer top-down path.

The top-down, statement-first reading a math document wants comes from the
**prose**, not from reordering the code: in the `.ken.md` format (§9) open a
section with the motivation and the claim in Markdown, then give the
definitions and proof bottom-up in the code blocks below. The document reads
lede-first even though the code still elaborates dependencies-first.

## 8. Local `let`: naming an intermediate

`let name = rhs in body` gives an intermediate expression a local name. Add a
type after the name when it improves the contract or guides elaboration:
`let name : Type = rhs in body`. The binding is non-recursive: the name is in
scope in `body`, but not in its own `rhs`.

The first two examples deliberately keep the surrounding computation small so
the inferred and annotated forms are easy to see. In ordinary code, use a
binding when the name states a domain concept, proof endpoint, invariant, or
stage that would otherwise be visible only as nested syntax. Expression length
is evidence, never the decision. Keep a familiar one-step expression, a small
exhaustive match, direct recursion, or a single constructor assembly inline
when a local name would merely repeat its syntax. There is no binding quota,
depth threshold, or minimum count.

```ken example
fn let_inferred (c : Color) : Bool = let selected_red = is_red c in selected_red

fn let_annotated (c : Color) : Bool = let selected_red : Bool = is_red c in selected_red
```

A short pipeline can name stages without hiding the final control flow. If the
list of unrelated stages grows long, extract a helper rather than building a
local namespace:

```ken example
fn let_staged_color (c : Color) : Bool =
  let
    selected_red = is_red c;
    confirmed_red =
      match selected_red {
        True ↦ True;
        False ↦ False
      }
  in
    confirmed_red
```

Proofs are values too. A proof-valued binding makes the evidence role explicit,
and the rest of the body checks against its stated type:

```ken example
lemma return_self_evidence (x : Bool) (evidence : Equal Bool x x) : Equal Bool x x = evidence

lemma let_proof_value (x : Bool) : Equal Bool x x =
  let self_evidence : Equal Bool x x = Refl in return_self_evidence x self_evidence
```

Bind at the narrowest scope containing every use. A branch-specific stage stays
inside that branch rather than being hoisted before the `match`:

```ken example
fn let_inside_branch (c : Color) : Bool =
  match c {
    Red ↦ let branch_is_red = is_red c in branch_is_red;
    Green ↦ False;
    Blue ↦ False
  }
```

The asymmetric scope rule is observable. This accepted declaration uses the
binder in the body:

```ken example
const let_rhs_zero : Nat = let bound_value : Nat = Zero in bound_value
```

This declaration is rejected with
`UnresolvedCon { name = "self_rhs_probe" }` at the right-hand-side occurrence;
the binder is not recursive and does not scope over its own definition:

```ken reject
const let_rhs_self : Nat = let self_rhs_probe : Nat = self_rhs_probe in self_rhs_probe
```

Ken is call-by-value. An effectful `let` evaluates its right-hand side before
its body, so it sequences effects as well as naming a value. Never hoist an
effectful computation out of a branch, or across another effect, merely to name
or share it. A style refactor must preserve branch placement and effect order.

## 9. The `.ken.md` literate format

This guide (and every catalog package) is itself written in `.ken.md`: an
ordinary Markdown file whose fenced code blocks carry a checked role. Only
an exact ` ```ken ` fence tangles into the compiled module; the fence
taxonomy is `07-catalog-style-guide.md §3`:

| Fence | Tangles? | CI checks | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `` ```ken `` | yes | must elaborate | the component itself |
| `` ```ken ignore `` | no | none | pure illustration, e.g. a fragment |
| `` ```ken reject `` | no | asserts rejection | a pitfall kept honest |
| `` ```ken example `` | no | elaborates, not shipped | checked usage/walkthrough |

Everything above ` ```ken example ` in this strand is *checked, not
shipped* — a reader can trust it compiles without it becoming part of any
module. Use ` ```ken reject ` for a genuine negative example (something
that must fail and whose failure is worth teaching), and reserve
` ```ken ignore ` for a fragment too small to elaborate on its own (a bare
type signature, a snippet missing its surrounding declarations).

## Design notes

- **Why explicit type parameters over implicit ones**: the elaborator's
  `instance_search`/unification story for implicit-argument inference is
  still developing (the CAT-2 `class`-dictionary rulings track this); explicit
  parameters are unambiguous today and cost the caller one extra argument at
  each call site. Prefer them until the guide says otherwise.
- **Why refinements over a separate assertion mechanism**: a refinement is
  *in the type*, so every caller sees the postcondition at the call site
  without reading the body — the same reason `sort`'s result type states
  "sorted and a permutation" rather than a comment saying so.
- **Reserved sugar identifiers — three names you cannot declare, two you
  usually can.** `Refl`, `Axiom`, `absurd`, `J`, and `Eq` are all
  checked-mode surface sugar, but they don't all reserve their name the same
  way (`elab.rs`'s special forms; `resolve::RESERVED_SUGAR`/`SUGAR_*`):
  - `Refl` and `Axiom` intercept a bare occurrence of their own name
    unconditionally, at any arity — a declared global under either name is
    wholly unreachable.
  - `absurd` intercepts a 1-argument application (`absurd h`) — the
    canonical, and only meaningful, use of a value so named.
  - Declaring `fn absurd (...) = ...`, or a `data`/explicit-family
    constructor literally named `Refl`/`Axiom`/`absurd`, no longer silently
    shadows the sugar — it's a resolve-time hard error (FR-2,
    `docs/program/wp/ds-1-findings-remediation.md`):

    ```ken reject
    -- Fails: 'absurd' collides with a reserved surface sugar identifier.
    fn absurd (C : Type) (e : Bool) : C = absurd e
    ```

    Pick a different name for the same idea — DS-1's `Empty` eliminator,
    for example, is named `absurd_empty`, not `absurd`.
  - `J` and `Eq`, by contrast, only intercept a **3-argument** application
    (`Eq A a b`, `J motive base eq`) — the kernel equality/`J` sugar. A
    lower-arity type-former or `class` of the same name **coexists
    correctly and is not an error** — this is by design, not an oversight:
    the landed `class Eq a` (`Core/LawfulClasses.ken`) is arity-1 and never
    collides with the arity-3 equality sugar, so declaring your own
    lower-arity `Eq`/`J` is fine.

    ```ken example
    class Eq a { eq : a -> a -> Bool }
    ```

## Findings

- **`prop`'s `where` block is v0-limited to a trivial seed shape**
  (`elab.rs::validate_seed_prop_shape`): an intro's conclusion must reapply
  the family to exactly its own bound parameters, so genuine inductive
  relations (list-append-shaped, order-shaped) can't be expressed as a
  `prop where` block yet — §7 above teaches the `lemma`-with-explicit-goal
  workaround instead. Routed as a language-surface follow-on (retro-action
  wiring, `README.md`): widening the seed shape to accept fresh premise
  binders and constructor-applied arguments is Language's call, not a
  catalog-authoring one.
