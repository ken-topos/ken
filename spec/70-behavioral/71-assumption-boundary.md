## 1. What the export is

When Ken finishes checking a program it emits a stable artifact — the
**behavioral export** — the **rely/guarantee contract** of the verification
boundary: a faithful statement of *what Ken guaranteed* (`Q`, proved), *what Ken
relied on* (`P`, assumed), and *what Ken stated but delegated* (`T`). It is not
only the residual Ken could not close — the guaranteed half `Q` is exported too,
precisely so a downstream engine may **assume** rather than re-prove it. Every
field carries its **epistemic status** (`../20-verification/21 §5.2`), and
the whole projects verified content, so the contract states **exactly**
what Ken established — no more (§2.1).

The export is a **broadcast contract**, not a point-to-point channel: it is read
by a *family* of downstream consumers — a **static verifier** (model-check `T`
against `Q`/`P`), a **test generator** (`G` + the sampling policy), and a
**runtime conformance monitor** (`73`) — each applying its own policy to many of
the same outputs. `Ward` (ADR 0006) is the umbrella for these engines; the
runtime monitor is plausibly a *distinct* engine (a sidecar), which sharpens the
"two engines" framing to **Ken + a family of behavioral engines sharing one
export and one logic**.

Two properties make it trustworthy:

- **It is a contract, not a dump** — an **assume-guarantee** record (§2). The
  shape is the permanent framing of a verification boundary (rely/guarantee),
  not an ad-hoc payload.
- **It is *generated*, never hand-authored.** Every field is a projection of
  Ken's verified content — proved `Q`, the residual `P` from
  `trusted_base_delta` (`../20-verification/25 §3`), the effect alphabet from
  the interaction-tree denotation (`OQ-8`, `../30-surface/36 §2`), the
  `Temporal` values written in source (`72`). It therefore **cannot overclaim**:
  it states exactly the four-way epistemic status (`../20-verification/21 §5`),
  with no room to assert more than Ken proved. This is the structural antidote
  to model↔code drift — the model is a *function of the code* (`73`).

## 2. The schema — an assume-guarantee contract

The export has five parts. The first four are **Ken-native** (faithful to Ken's
own terms — they are what `Ward` *reasons about*, and "one logic, two engines"
requires their meaning be identical on both sides); concrete execution witnesses
are a separate **ITF** layer (§3).

| Part | Carries | Status | Downstream use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`guarantees` (Q)** | proved postconditions & per-space invariants | `proved` | invariants the model may *assume*, not re-prove → smaller state space |
| **`assumptions` (P)** | the assumption boundary: `trusted_base_delta`, explicit `assume`s, boundary labels | `tested` | the nondeterministic *environment*; the generator's input domain |
| **`alphabet` (Σ)** | the interaction-tree perform-node signatures (`OQ-8`) | — | the behavioral state machine's **event alphabet**; the monitor's alphabet |
| **`obligations` (T)** | the `Temporal` data values stated in source (`72`) | `delegated` | LTL / μ-calculus properties to model-check and monitor |
| **`generators` (G)** | refinement/dependent-type **support structure** (§4) | derived | the *territory map* for spec-driven test generation |

`Σ` is **reuse, not reinvention**: the event vocabulary `Ward` monitors over
*is* the interaction tree's perform-node signatures. `Ward` watches exactly the
events Ken's denotation can emit; there is no separate alphabet to define or
keep in sync.

### 2.1 The projection — verified status to export field

The export is **generated**: each field is the image of a total projection from
already-verified content, never a hand-authored payload. Two things must be
pinned for the emitter to be implementable and for the contract to be
trustworthy: **where each verification status lands**, and **what discriminates
a guarantee from an assumption**. Both are settled here so the conformance
author inherits no silence to fill.

**Status → field (the classification boundary, pinned).** A claim's epistemic
status (`21 §5.2`: `proved` / `tested` / `delegated` / `unknown`) determines its
field. The verdict trichotomy (`21 §5.1`: `proved` / `disproved` / `unknown`)
relates to it by the projection of `21 §5.3`. The export map is total over
*exportable* claims and explicit about the one verdict that does **not** export
(a refuted claim):

| Source claim | Epistemic status | Export field | Entry status |
|---|---|---|---|
| proved postcondition / space-invariant | `proved` | **`Q`** | `proved` |
| explicit `assume`/`test` clause, boundary label | `tested` | **`P`** | `tested` |
| open typed hole (postulate of the goal) | `unknown` | **`P`** | `unknown` |
| `Temporal` property stated in source | `delegated` | **`T`** | `delegated` |
| refuted claim (countermodel) | *(none, `21 §5.3`)* | **never exported** | — |

- **`Q` and `P` partition the propositional claims; `unknown` rides `P`, never
  `Q`.** An open hole is a *postulate* of its goal (`24 §2`) — an honest
  assumption the downstream must treat as environment, exactly like an explicit
  `assume`. It therefore lands in `P` (tagged `unknown`), beside the `tested`
  entries. A shippable artifact has an **empty `trusted_base_delta`** (`25 §3`,
  the honesty guard) — i.e. **no** `unknown` entries — or an explicit recorded
  acceptance of the listed ones; either way they are never silently promoted.
- **A `disproved` claim never exports.** A refuted claim is a verification error
  to *fix*, not a guarantee to ship (`21 §5.3`, `24 §3`); it has no epistemic
  status and no export field. The emitter that finds a `disproved` verdict emits
  **nothing** for that claim (the build does not produce a shippable export).
- **`Σ` and `G` carry no epistemic status.** `Σ` is a *vocabulary* (the
  perform-node signatures) and `G` is a *partition* — neither is a claim, so
  neither is tagged `proved`/`tested`/etc.

**The discriminator is kernel-side, not a self-reported label (`21 §5.4`).**
What puts a claim in `Q` rather than `P` is **structural**, decided from the
kernel's own state: a claim is a **guarantee iff** its certificate `check`s
**and** its goal is **not** a postulate in `GlobalEnv::trusted_base()`
(`18 §4`/`§5`); otherwise it is an **assumption**. The emitter never trusts the
(untrusted) verification layer's status string — it reads `trusted_base()`
membership + certificate presence. This is the load-bearing **no-over-claim**
invariant (AC2): the *same* proposition emits under `Q` when proved and under
`P`/`T` when its proof is a hole or a delegation — the field **flips** with
the kernel state, a structural signal, not a green-vs-green string compare.

**Per-field source of truth and projection.** Each field names the landed
artifact it reads and the function that projects it (no field invents content):

- **`Q` (guarantees)** ← claims with status `proved`. Read the discharged
  `ensures`/space-invariant obligations (verdict `proved`, `25 §3`); emit each
  proposition. The kernel already checked the certificate — the emitter
  **reads** the verdict, it does **not** re-prove (no kernel work).
- **`P` (assumptions)** ← assumption boundary: `trusted_base_delta` (`25 §3`,
  the postulates/holes this target adds) ∪ explicit `assume`/`test` clauses ∪
  boundary labels (FFI / untrusted-input / IFC labels, `../60-security/61`).
  Each entry tagged `tested` or `unknown` per the table. Boundary-`Q`/`P`
  producers such as Sec1ct's CT-in-parameter promise (`../60-security/61 §5a.4`)
  feed this channel — coordinate the boundary obligation's shape via spec, do
  **not** pre-bind field names across WPs (§3.1).
- **`Σ` (alphabet)** ← interaction-tree perform-node signatures, **verbatim**
  (`OQ-8`, `../30-surface/36 §2`: the `Effect` container `Op`/`Resp`, the `Vis`
  nodes; admitted as of K1.5, `f037451`). Emit exactly the signatures the
  program's denotation can perform — **not** a re-derived alphabet (AC4 asserts
  structural equality to the denotation's signatures). No second alphabet.
- **`T` (obligations)** ← claims with status `delegated`: the `Temporal` data
  values stated in source (`72`, `OQ-temporal`). Emit each as an obligation
  tagged `delegated`. B1 structures **the channel** (the values + their status +
  the `Σ` they range over); the `Temporal` **datatype** and the `compile`
  faithfulness lemma are **B2/B3** (§5.2) — emit what exists.
- **`G` (generators)** ← refinement predicates `{x:A | φ}` and `match` arms in
  the checked program. Project the equivalence-class **partition**, the
  **boundaries**, and the **case decomposition** (§4) — **support only**, no
  measure (the sealed type, §4.1).

## 3. Two layers: Ken-native contract, ITF traces

- **Propositional/contract layer → Ken-native.** `Q`, `P`, `Σ`, `T`, and `G`'s
  predicates are the objects `Ward` reasons about; they must be semantically
  faithful to Ken's terms. A lossy translation here would break the single-logic
  guarantee.
- **Trace layer → ITF** (Apalache/Quint's *Informal Trace Format*). Concrete
  execution and counterexample witnesses are the cheap interop currency, and
  `Ward`'s downstream tools already speak ITF. Adopting it buys immediate
  Quint/Apalache/MOP interop with no bespoke format to maintain. The trace layer
  carries **witnesses, not claims** — it has no epistemic status and feeds no
  `Q`; a green trace is evidence for a `delegated` `T`, never a promotion of it
  (§5.1).

### 3.1 The contract serialization — locked structure, deferred spelling

The contract layer is **Ken-native** and serialized as the five fields of §2.
What is **locked** (normative, conformance-checkable) versus **deferred** to the
`Ward` wire pass is pinned explicitly, per *defer-spelling-not-concept* — the
risk being a contract that either over-freezes a token Ward must finalize or
leaves an invariant unstated for the conformance author to fill differently.

**Locked (normative):**

- The **five-part structure** `{ Q, P, Σ, T, G }` and each field's **value-set**
  — `Q`/`P`/`T` are sets of status-tagged propositions/obligations; `Σ` is a set
  of perform-node signatures; `G` is a support structure (§4.1).
- The **per-entry status tag** (`proved`/`tested`/`unknown`/`delegated`,
  §2.1) — every `Q`/`P`/`T` entry carries exactly one, from the projection.
- The **cross-field invariants** (below), which any conforming serialization
  must satisfy regardless of token spelling.
- The **content-hash stability discipline** (§3.3): the export is
  content-addressed, so a **rename after the spelling binds is a breaking
  change** (a new hash, a new contract version) — the concept is stable across
  the rename even though the literal key is not yet frozen.

**Deferred (`(oracle)`-tagged):** the **literal serialized keys** for the five
fields and the per-entry tag (e.g. whether the wire token is `guarantees` /
`guarantee` / `Q`). `Ward` finalizes the wire token against its parsers; Ken
fixes the concept and the stability discipline. Conformance pins the value-set
and invariants and `(oracle)`-tags the literal key (`conformance-assert-at-
locked-granularity`).

**Cross-field invariants (the consistency net — conformance asserts each):**

- **I1 — no over-claim (honesty).** Every `Q` entry traces to a `proved` verdict
  whose goal is **absent** from `trusted_base()`; **no** `Q` entry's goal is a
  postulate. Equivalently: nothing in `Q` carries status `tested`/`unknown`/
  `delegated`. (AC2; the §2.1 discriminator.)
- **I2 — assumption visibility.** Every postulate in this target's
  `trusted_base_delta` (`25 §3`) appears as a `P` entry; removing an `assume` or
  shrinking the delta **removes** the matching `P` entry (and changes the hash,
  §3.3). (AC3.)
- **I3 — alphabet closure.** Every event symbol mentioned by a `T` obligation,
  by `G`, or by the monitor contract (`73 §2`) is a member of `Σ`; and `Σ`
  contains **exactly** the denotation's perform-nodes — no orphan symbol, no
  missing node. (AC4.)
- **I4 — delegated never proved.** Every `T` entry carries status `delegated`;
  no projection path stamps a `T` (or `P`) entry `proved` (§5.1, the one-way
  gate). (AC6.)
- **I5 — no measure.** No `G` entry carries a weight / likelihood / probability;
  `G` is partition + boundaries + case-decomposition only — enforced at the type
  level (§4.1). (AC5.)

### 3.2 The trace layer — ITF

Concrete execution and counterexample **witnesses** serialize as ITF
(Apalache/Quint's *Informal Trace Format*), a separate layer from the contract.
This is interop currency, not part of the propositional contract: ITF traces are
read by `Ward`'s downstream tools (Quint/Apalache/MOP) with no bespoke format to
maintain, and — per §3 above — carry no epistemic status.

### 3.3 Content-addressing and provenance

The export is **versioned and content-addressed**. The hash is taken over a
**canonical form** of the contract (deterministic field and entry order, a
normalized form of each proposition) so that the **same checked program
yields the same hash** (AC1) — the projection is a deterministic function of the
verified content, and canonicalization removes serialization-order freedom.

The hash **travels in provenance** (`../60-security/63 §2`): it links *this
model* to *this build*, which is what makes "this `Ward` model corresponds to
this code" checkable rather than asserted — the hook trace-conformance (`73`)
builds on. The hash is what the **discharge attestation** binds to: "the Ken
export answered" is recorded as the content-hash of the `Q`/`P`/`Σ`/`T`/`G`
contract (`../60-security/63 §5a`), so `export_hash ↔ build` (provenance) and
`export_hash ↔ discharge` (attestation) are both reproducible — a delegated
obligation's classical discharge is bound 1:1 to exactly the export that stated
it.

## 4. Generators carry support, never measure

A refinement type `{x:A | φ}` is a **generator and an oracle** — but generating
*representative* tests means sampling over the combinatorics of state
equivalence classes, and that decomposes into two parts of very different
epistemic status:

- **Support — Ken owns it, faithfully.** *Which* states are valid, and the
  **structure** of that space: the equivalence-class **partition**, the
  **boundaries** between classes, and the **case decomposition** all fall out of
  refinement predicates and `match` arms (equivalence-partitioning and
  boundary-value analysis are *derivable*). Ken exports this partition as `G` —
  an honest map of the territory — claiming nothing about likelihood.
- **Measure — Ken never supplies it.** *Which* valid states are likely /
  important / risky / cheap / judged-out-of-scope. This is business logic, risk
  weighting, operational/UI exclusions, and the empirical data population in
  running systems — **human and environmental judgment**, not a derivable fact.
  A distribution fitted to production traffic is the opposite of a static proof,
  and it is **per-deployment** (the same component needs a different measure as
  an internal API vs. an external endpoint). It therefore lives **outside Ken
  source** — in the same class of deployment-adjacent artifacts as a
  `Dockerfile` or Terraform — as a separately-authored **sampling policy**
  (`OQ-sampling-policy`, hosted on `Ward`'s side, governed like the security
  policy of `../60-security/65`). Ken's exported partition is the **vocabulary**
  that policy indexes its weights over; the two compose with no overlap.

**Exclusions bifurcate** accordingly: an exclusion that is an *invariant* ("this
state never arises because operation `X` maintains `I`") is propositional and
rides the existing **`P`/`Q`** channels (tightening the support, where Ken can
*check* it); an exclusion that is a *judgment* ("valid and reachable, but
low-risk") is a **measure** decision (weight ≈ 0) and belongs to the sampling
policy. Ken handles the first kind already; it stays silent on the second.

### 4.1 The no-measure invariant — exhaustive by construction

"`G` carries support, never measure" must be a **type-level impossibility, not a
convention** a careful author upholds. The `G` payload type admits **only**
support constructors — the equivalence-class **partition**, the **boundaries**
between classes, and the **case decomposition** (the `match` arms) — and has
**no** field, variant, or escape hatch into which a number could be interpreted
as a likelihood/weight/probability. "A measure leaked into `G`" is then **not
representable**: a serialization with a per-class weight does not type, and a
new support-kind added without a measure-free type is a **compile error**, not a
silent gap (COORDINATION §7, exhaustive-by-construction — the same sealed,
no-catch-all discipline as the `LeakSink` set of `../60-security/61 §5a.2`).

This seal is load-bearing because of **what the kernel does not see**. The
emitter is an untrusted projection (no kernel enlargement); the kernel never
inspects the **export bytes**, so a measure leaked into `G` would **not** be
caught downstream of the emitter by any kernel check. The net is therefore two
things and only these: the **type-level seal** in the emitter (measure
unrepresentable) and **conformance AC5** (an attempt to attach a weight is
rejected / not representable). Enumerate what the kernel cannot backstop — the
serialized `G` — and seal it where it is built. (This is the `G` instance of the
erased-before-kernel omission-hole the security labels face: the discriminating
check must live where the untrusted projection happens, since the trust root
sees nothing.)

## 5. Seam soundness — one-way flow & translation faithfulness

Ken is intuitionistic/total/constructive; `Ward`'s engines are classical
(model-checkers decide truth in a model). The seam composes the two **soundly**
and **legibly** by three commitments (`OQ-classical-bridge`).

**One-way flow (Ken → Ward), strictly.** Ken *exports* obligations `T` and
assumptions `P`; `Ward` discharges them by classical means; **results never
re-enter Ken as proof terms.** A depth-`k` model-check is not a proof for all
`N`; a green monitor is not a proof. So a discharged obligation stays
`delegated`/`tested` in the four-way status (`../20-verification/21 §5`) and
rides in `trusted_base_delta` — it is **never promoted to `proved`**. This is a
deliberate choice for **human legibility** as much as soundness: consumers read
one direction of flow, not a bidirectional logic.

**Soundness by assume-guarantee construction.** Every Ken theorem is conditional
— "**given** `P`, **then** `Q`" — and that implication is intuitionistically
valid and kernel-checked *regardless of how `P` is later discharged*. Because
Ken never imports `Ward`'s conclusion, no classical strength leaks into the
kernel; the classical discharge of `P` is a separate, lower-trust artifact (the
discharge attestation, below). Where the obligation is *decidable/finite-state*,
classical and intuitionistic truth coincide anyway (a decision procedure gives
`P ∨ ¬P` constructively, `../20-verification/23 §2`); where it is unbounded, it
is an honest assumption.

**Translation faithfulness — the Ken-checked half.** `Ward` consumes a
model-checker input, not Ken's datatype, so a translation `τ` mediates; an
*unfaithful* `τ` (a green check on a spec that doesn't match the code) is worse
than none. `τ` splits:

- **Property translation** `compile : Temporal Σ → WardFormula` (`72 §3`). Both
  sides are syntax over the same alphabet `Σ`, so Ken proves `compile`
  **semantics-preserving once, at the compiler level** — `⟦φ⟧ = ⟦compile φ⟧`
  over `Σ`-traces, an ordinary structural induction (the "reason *about*
  formulas" power, `72 §2`). Required, but **amortized to zero per obligation**
  — every delegated property reuses the one lemma. This is the exact analog of
  the prover's Kripke-adequacy lemma (`../20-verification/23 §4`).
- **Model translation** — the transition system `Ward` explores corresponds to
  the program's denoted behaviors. Ken's contribution is *structural*: the model
  is **generated** from the code (`Σ` *is* the perform-node signatures; the
  state machine derives from the space semantics), so authoring drift is
  impossible by construction. The residual concrete-vs-abstract gap is the
  **conformance** story (`73`) plus an honest assumption — not a single Ken
  proof.

**The one trust edge, pinned.** The faithfulness proof is *relative to an
axiomatized `Ward` semantics*; that `Ward` *implements* it is the one explicit,
version-bounded assumption — **pinned as the `Ward` version in the discharge
attestation** (`../60-security/63 §5a`). The attestation is therefore not
bureaucracy: it is the anchor of the faithfulness argument.

### 5.1 The one-way gate — no promotion path (the G-Ward-seam)

The one-way-flow commitment is realized in the emitter as the **absence of a
code path**, not a runtime check that could be bypassed: the emitter is a pure
**read-and-project** over verified content (the `25 §3` verdict document + the
denotation), and there is **no function** in it from a `Ward` verdict — or any
classical result — to a `proved` status. Concretely:

- The emitter **only reads** epistemic status it did not author (`21 §5`) and
  **projects** it (§2.1); it never **writes** a status.
- There is **no ingest path**: a classically-discharged obligation re-enters the
  Ken side only as a `trusted_base_delta` entry / a discharge-attestation record
  (`63 §5a`), tagged `delegated`/`tested` — **never** a certificate the kernel
  would re-check, and **never** re-stamped `proved`.
- A `delegated`/`tested` entry is therefore **monotone**: nothing in the export
  pipeline raises it to `proved` (invariant I4).

**AC6 asserts this gate structurally** — *there is no path from a `Ward` verdict
to a `proved` status* (the G-Ward-seam gate acceptance): a `Ward` "green" fed
back through the emitter leaves it `delegated`, and the conformance corpus
pins the **absence** of any promoting transition (a guard-gated absence, named:
no `proved`-writing edge exists, not merely "the happy path doesn't take one").

### 5.2 What B1 fixes vs. what B2/B3 own

The `compile : Temporal Σ → WardFormula` faithfulness lemma (`72 §3`; the
amortized-once structural induction above, analog of the Kripke-adequacy lemma
`23 §4`) is **owned by B2/B3** — it needs the `Temporal` **datatype** (B2) and
the trace/runtime contract (B3). **B1 fixes what that lemma reuses**: the `T`
**channel** (the `delegated` obligation values + their status, structured for
the alphabet they range over) and the `Σ` **alphabet** itself (§2.1). B1 proves
no new metatheory; it pins the two interfaces `compile` and the model
translation will be stated over, so B2/B3 build the lemma without re-litigating
the channel or the alphabet (coordinate cross-WP via spec, do not hard-bind wire
spellings, §3.1).

## 6. What this chapter delivers, and its acceptance

The export emitter lives in `crates/ken-elaborator` and is, end to end, a
**deterministic projection of verified content** — it adds nothing to the
trusted base and proves nothing new. The implementable deliverables:

1. **The five-part projection (§2.1)** — each of `Q`/`P`/`Σ`/`T`/`G` from its
   pinned source of truth, with the **status → field** map and the kernel-side
   **honesty discriminator** (`trusted_base()` membership + certificate
   presence, `21 §5.4`).
2. **The two-layer serialization (§3)** — Ken-native contract + ITF traces, with
   the **value-set and cross-field invariants I1–I5 locked** and the literal
   field **spellings `(oracle)`-tagged** (Ward finalizes the wire token; Ken
   locks the concept + the content-hash stability discipline).
3. **Content-addressing + provenance (§3.3)** — a canonical-form hash,
   deterministic in the checked program, embedded in provenance (`63 §2`) and
   bound 1:1 by the discharge attestation (`63 §5a`).
4. **The sealed no-measure `G` (§4.1)** — measure **unrepresentable** at the
   type level (exhaustive-by-construction), the net being the seal + conformance
   AC5 since the kernel does not see the export bytes.
5. **The one-way-flow gate (§5.1)** — no code path promotes a `delegated`/
   `tested` obligation to `proved`; the `compile` lemma is named as B2/B3's,
   with the `T` channel + `Σ` it reuses fixed here (§5.2).

**Acceptance criteria.** *Names align with the frame's AC1–AC6.*

- **AC1 (reproducible).** Same program → **same export hash** (structural
  assertion on the hash, §3.3), not merely "an export is produced".
- **AC2 (no over-claim).** Every `Q` entry traces to a `proved` result with no
  postulate of its goal in `trusted_base()`; an **unproved** postcondition emits
  under `P`/`assume` (tagged `unknown`/`tested`), **never** `Q`. *Flips*
  proved→`Q` vs unknown→`P` on the **same** postcondition (invariant I1).
- **AC3 (assumption visibility).** Removing an `assume` / shrinking the
  `trusted_base_delta` shows up as a changed `P` (and a changed hash, I2).
- **AC4 (`Σ` reuse).** `Σ` equals the program's L5 perform-node signatures —
  asserted as **structural equality** to the denotation's signatures, not a
  re-derived alphabet (I3).
- **AC5 (no-measure).** No `G` field can carry a weight; the attempt is rejected
  / not representable (§4.1, I5). `G` is partition + boundaries only.
- **AC6 (one-way / G-Ward-seam).** **No `Ward` result is ever recorded as
  `proved`** — assert **no** code path runs from a `Ward` verdict to a
  `proved` status (§5.1, I4).

**Conformance (`../../conformance/behavioral/export/`).** AC1–AC6 as
discriminating cases, each **routing a real checked program through the actual
emitter** and observing the projected field — **not** a synthetic export literal
with asserted fields (a test that builds an export struct and checks a field
guards nothing; the QA gate is *real verified content → real projection*). Each
case **flips** on its bug (per-case verdict/structural-flip); the **cross-case
sweep** groups by the status-projection class and asserts agreement —
{`proved`→`Q`}, {`tested`→`P`, `unknown`→`P`}, {`delegated`→`T`} — with the two
**boundary invariants** pinned: **no non-`proved` claim ever lands in `Q`** (the
honesty direction, AC2/I1) and **no `Ward` result ever lands in `proved`** (the
one-way direction, AC6/I4). *Worked flip (AC2):* a function with
`ensures result > 0` emits that postcondition under `Q` (status `proved`) when
its obligation discharges, and under `P` (status `unknown`) when the proof is
left an open hole — the field flips with `trusted_base()` membership, a
structural signal, the same program under the two kernel states.
