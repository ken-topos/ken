# ES4 lawful structure classes (`Eq`/`DecEq`/`Ord`) conformance — seed cases

Format: `../../README.md`. These pin the **laws-PROVED discipline** of the first
`packages/` catalog tranche (`spec/50-stdlib/51-lawful-classes.md`, ES4-classes)
— the pattern every later ES4 package follows. The load-bearing property is
**AC3**: on an **inductive carrier** an instance's **law fields are real
kernel proofs**, so "lawful instance ≡ zero-`trusted_base()`-delta instance"; a
law-**less** dictionary (postulated laws it *could* have proved) must be
**rejected as unlawful**. A **primitive** carrier (`Int`/…) is the honest
exception — its ∀-laws are **unprovable** (no eliminator), so its instance
carries a **declared audited delta** (`§6`), not zero — the carrier axis is
load-bearing. (The zero-delta *real-proofs* path is **K4-staged** — see **K4
staging** below; **pre-K4 all instances are audited-delta**.)

## Grounding (content-verified against the landed targets)

- `51-lawful-classes.md` — the three classes as **structure classes**
  (`33 §5.1`): op fields `Type`-valued, **law fields `Ω`-valued** (`§3`);
  totality is the **Bool-equation** `IsTrue (leq x y || leq y x)` (Ω-clean, no
  truncation, `§3`); an instance is a `declare_def` **record value carrying real
  law proofs** (`§5`); **zero `trusted_base()` delta on an inductive carrier**,
  an **audited delta** on a primitive carrier (`§6`, the **two-axes rule**: law
  *sort* Ω-clean **and** carrier *provability* via an eliminator); `where Ord a`
  supplies the same `leq` the explicit `sort` threads (`§4`).
- `33 §5.1`/`§5.2`/`§5.3` — a class is a **record** (`13 §3` Σ+η); the sort is
  kernel-computed (both-components-keyed `sort_sigma`, `13 §4`); an instance is
  a record value of ops **+ law proofs**. **No new kernel former.**
- `37 §6` — the verified `sort`'s explicit `leq : a→a→Bool` (ES2-remainder
  `2358b4d`) that `Ord` subsumes; the `isSorted leq ys ∧ Perm ys xs` obligation.
- `25 §3` — `trusted_base_delta`; `16 §1` — `Ω`/proof-irrelevance;
  `../surface/taxonomy/minimality.md` (ES1) — the zero-delta / surface-TB-Sound
  invariant AC3 is the **law-side reading** of.

## Scope — the law-side of the ES1 zero-delta invariant

AC3 is not a new soundness mechanism: it is the ES1 **zero-`trusted_base()`
delta** invariant read from the law side (`51 §5`). A law field inhabited by a
`postulate` is an `Opaque` entry → **non-empty delta**; a holed field **fails
the kernel re-check**. So the corpus reuses the ES1/Sec4 `trusted_base()` net
(`../surface/taxonomy/minimality.md`, `../../security/trust-model/`) — it does
**not** re-pin the delta mechanism, it pins that a **class instance's law fields
are subject to it**. **The carrier axis (`51 §6`) qualifies the equivalence:**
"lawful ≡ zero-delta" holds **on an inductive carrier** (whose ∀-laws are
kernel-provable by case-split/induction); a **primitive** carrier's ∀-laws are
**unprovable** (no eliminator), so its instance is separately an
**audited-delta** one (a *declared*, visible delta — the honest primitive
posture, not a defect). The verified-`sort` obligation itself is homed in
`../surface/collections/` (`sort-emits-issorted-and-perm`); AC2 here references
it, does not re-pin it.

**Tags.** `(soundness)` — the laws-PROVED gate (a law-less instance admitted as
lawful is a verification-soundness hole: downstream lemmas *assume the laws*).
`(oracle)` — the literal field spellings (`leq`/`eq`/`refl`/`antisym`/… — the
`51` naming, finalizable). The **law-field `Ω`-sorts, the zero-delta lawfulness,
the same-obligation subsumption, and every verdict** are **normative**.

**Static vs runtime face.** These pin the **static face** — the spec discipline
(lawful ≡ zero-delta on an inductive carrier) and the discriminating shape. The
**runtime/build face** — the actual canonical instances in `packages/` carrying
real proof terms, producer-grepped for `declare_postulate`/holes on the law
fields — is the named **Team-Language build follow-on** (`51 §8`), not this WP
(`soundness-ac-static-vs-runtime-face`).

**K4 staging — the *zero-delta real-proofs* path is gated on a kernel capability
(`51 §6`).** Proving a per-branch law (`∀x. IsTrue (leq x x)`) needs the kernel
to eliminate an inductive into an **Ω-motive** (`λx. P x : Bool → Ω`) — the
**forward kernel WP K4** (`14 §3` currently admits only a `Type`-codomain
motive). So on **today's kernel no carrier can prove its ∀-laws** — `Bool`/user
`data` included, **not** just `Int` — and **every** lawful instance is built
**audited-delta** (postulated laws need no Ω-elimination). Two nets below are
therefore **`(gated: K4)`**: the **accept arm** + the **postulate-is-a-defect**
verdict of `law-fields-real-proofs-not-postulates` (a postulate is *avoidable*,
hence a defect, only once the proof is constructable), and the **carrier
separation** of `primitive-carrier-declared-audited-delta` (**pre-K4 the axis
collapses** — all carriers audited-delta). **Live today** (K4-independent): the
**declared-vs-hidden** sub-net (a manifest claiming zero while the actual
`trusted_base_delta` is non-empty is caught) and the **holed** (re-check fail) /
**missing** (uninhabited record) reject arms. The **design is unchanged**
(`51 §6`); only build-time availability is staged — tag the K4-gated seams now
(`tag-deferred-seam-cases-at-elaboration-time`), don't discover them at build.

## AC3 — laws PROVED, not postulated (the hard soundness gate)

`51 §5`: an instance carries **real** proofs of its law fields; a
law-less/postulated/holed instance is **rejected as unlawful** (non-empty
`trusted_base_delta` / re-check failure).

### stdlib/classes/law-fields-real-proofs-not-postulates (soundness)
- spec: `51 §5` (laws PROVED = zero-delta), `33 §5.3` (instance = record value +
  law proofs), `25 §3` (`trusted_base_delta`), `13 §2` (Σ-Intro re-check)
- given: two `Ord K`-shaped instances for a user carrier `K` (an **inductive**
  `data K` — it has an eliminator, so its ∀-laws are kernel-provable by
  case-split/induction; this is the precondition that makes a postulate a
  *defect*), **identical in their operation field** (`leq = k_leq`), differing
  **only** in the law fields: (a) a **canonical** instance whose
  `refl`/`antisym`/`trans`/`total` fields are **real kernel proofs**
  (a `declare_def` record value, re-checked); (b) a **law-less** instance whose
  law fields are `declare_postulate`d (and, as further arms, holed /
  stubbed-absent)
- expect: **the verdict flips.** (a) **accepts as lawful** — every law prop is
  kernel-proved, so the instance's **`trusted_base_delta` is empty** (the law
  props ∉ `trusted_base()`); (b) **rejected as unlawful** — a **postulated** law
  field is an `Opaque` entry → **non-empty `trusted_base_delta`** (violating
  zero-delta lawfulness); a **holed** field **fails the kernel re-check**; a
  **missing** field leaves the record value **uninhabited** (`Ord K` cannot be
  constructed). Assert the **observable**: (a) empty delta / law props ∉
  `trusted_base()`; (b) non-empty delta or re-check/inhabitation failure —
  **not** a message string.
- why: (soundness) AC3 — the whole point of a *lawful* class. **The postulated
  arm is the discriminating green-vs-green:** a postulated-law instance
  **type-checks** (the `Opaque` postulate inhabits the field), so a test that
  merely asserts "an `Ord K` **resolves**" passes it vacuously
  ([[conformance-hand-feeds-the-deliverable]]) — yet the "carries the
  total-order laws" guarantee is **assumed, not proved** (the prop rides
  `trusted_base()`). The net is **structural**: the two instances share the same
  `leq`, so the flip is **solely** on the law fields' provenance — **grep the
  law fields for `declare_postulate`/holes; their *absence* is the guarantee**
  ([[kernel-backed-claim-grep-the-emission-not-the-name]]). **Verdict-flip:**
  lawful-accepts vs unlawful-rejects on the same operation content — opposite
  observables, not both-accept. The predicate-definedness dual
  ([[lawful-class-instances-must-carry-law-proofs]]; the ES2 analog is
  `isSorted`/`Perm` **defined** not postulated). Does **not** re-pin the
  `trusted_base()` mechanism (ES1/Sec4) — pins that a class instance's law
  fields are subject to it. **Carrier precondition:** the postulate is a
  **defect here because `K` is inductive** (the laws *were* provable) — the same
  postulated field on a **primitive** carrier is the **honest audited-delta**
  (`primitive-carrier-declared-audited-delta` below), so the reject arm is
  conditioned on carrier provability, not on the postulate alone. **`(gated:
  K4)`:** the **accept** arm (a, real proofs → zero-delta) and this
  **postulate-is-a-defect** verdict need kernel Ω-motive elimination (K4 staging
  above) — **pre-K4 no carrier proves its ∀-laws**, so a postulate is not yet
  *avoidable*. **Live today:** the **holed** (re-check fail) / **missing**
  (uninhabited record) arms and the declared-vs-hidden honesty.

### stdlib/classes/primitive-carrier-declared-audited-delta (soundness)
- spec: `51 §6` (the carrier axis — a primitive carrier is **audited-delta**,
  not zero-delta), `25 §3` (`trusted_base_delta`), `30 §6` F2 (audited primitive
  ops), `../../security/trust-model/` (Sec4 TCB)
- given: the **same** postulated `total` law field, on two carriers: (a) an
  **inductive** carrier (`Bool` / user `data`) whose `total` is **postulated**
  though it is **provable** by finite case-split; (b) a **primitive** carrier
  (`Ord Int`: `int_leq` fires on literals, **opaque to δ on a variable**; `Int`
  has **no induction principle**) whose `total` is **postulated because it is
  unprovable**, and **declared** in `trusted_base_delta` (the package
  manifest names it)
- expect: **the verdict flips on carrier provability.** (a) **rejected as a
  lawful (zero-delta) entry** — the law *was* provable, so the postulate is an
  **avoidable hidden delta**, a defect; (b) **accepted as an audited-delta
  lawful entry** — `Int` **cannot** prove the ∀-law (no eliminator), so a
  **declared** postulate is the **honest** posture (the same trusted-by-audit
  surface as the primitive op `int_leq` itself), the delta **visible** in
  `trusted_base_delta`. **Sub-net:** a **hidden/undeclared** primitive delta (a
  primitive instance **mislabeled zero-delta**) is **rejected** — the honesty is
  in the **declaration**, not the mere presence of a delta
- why: (soundness) the **carrier axis** the `§6` erratum makes load-bearing.
  Zero-delta lawfulness needs **two orthogonal preconditions**: the law's
  **sort** (Ω-clean — `ord-total-law-is-omega-bool-equation`) **and** the
  carrier's **provability** (inductive / has an eliminator). So the **same**
  postulated `total` is a **defect on `Bool`/user-`data`** (provable) yet the
  **honest audited-delta on `Int`** (unprovable) — the reject is keyed on
  *carrier provability*, not the postulate alone. Ken **ships** `Ord Int`/`Eq
  Int` (you cannot simply lack them, `§6`), so this path is **real**, not
  hypothetical; its trust posture is a primitive op's
  ([[tested-not-trusted-posture-needs-reachability-precondition]]). **Ties to
  Sec4 TCB accounting:** the law postulates are `Opaque`, the op `Primitive` —
  **both** legitimately in `trusted_base()` (`../../security/trust-model/`); the
  audited delta is honest iff **declared**, an over-claim iff **hidden**
  ([[kernel-backed-claim-grep-the-emission-not-the-name]]). Static face; the
  build lands the real instances + their manifest delta declarations. **`(gated:
  K4)`:** arm (a)'s reject (an inductive postulate = defect) needs Ω-motive
  elimination — **pre-K4 the axis collapses** (`Bool` can't prove its laws
  either, so **both** carriers are audited-delta and (a) *accepts* too). **Live
  today:** the **declared-vs-hidden** sub-net (a manifest's zero-delta claim vs
  the actual non-empty delta) — that honesty is K4-independent, and it is what
  keeps the audited-delta posture enforceable now.

### stdlib/classes/ord-total-law-is-omega-bool-equation (soundness)
- spec: `51 §3` (law-field sorts; totality is the Bool-equation), `16 §1`/`§6`
  (Ω / truncation), `13 §4` (`sort_sigma`)
- given: the `Ord a` `total` law field, in two formulations: (a) the **landed**
  Bool-equation `total : (x y) → IsTrue (leq x y || leq y x)`; (b) a **bare
  propositional disjunction**
  `total : (x y) → IsTrue (leq x y) ∨ IsTrue (leq y x)`
- expect: (a) is an **admissible `Ω` law field** —
  `IsTrue (leq x y || leq y x) = Eq Bool (leq x y || leq y x) True : Ω`,
  proof-irrelevant, **no truncation**; (b) is **not** an admissible law field as
  written — a bare `∨` is **proof-relevant** (`Type`-valued: *which* side holds
  is content), so it either makes the field relevant (the record carries extra
  content the law must not) or requires the truncation `‖·‖` (`16 §6`) to reach
  `Ω`. Assert that `total`'s field type is the **Ω Bool-equation**, not a
  `Type`-valued sum
- why: (soundness) the law-field-sort no-regression net — a law must be
  **proof-irrelevant** (`Ω`), and totality is the one law that is a *disjunction
  in spirit*. The **decidable `Bool` `leq` sidesteps** the truncation
  obligation: totality becomes a Bool-equation, `Ω`-clean. A build that
  reformulates `total` as a bare propositional `∨` reintroduces proof-relevance
  ([[proof-relevant-inductive-cannot-be-declared-at-omega]] — the ES1-`Perm`
  analog) — either leaking content into the "law" or silently needing
  truncation. This pins the corrected form forward (the same no-regression
  discipline as a trust-level erratum), so a later `Ord`-variant can't quietly
  regress the sort.

## AC2 — `Ord` subsumes the explicit comparator (reflect-don't-extend)

`51 §4`: `where Ord a` supplies the **same** `leq` the explicit `sort` threads
(`d.leq`, `33 §5.4`) — same view, no second `sort`.

### stdlib/classes/where-ord-same-sort-obligation (AC2)
- spec: `51 §4` (`Ord` subsumes the comparator), `33 §5.4` (`where C a` →
  implicit dict + projection), `37 §6`/`34 §5` (the `sort` obligation)
- given: the verified `sort` invoked two ways on the same `List a`: (a) the
  **explicit** form `sort leq xs` (ES2-remainder surface, `37 §6`); (b) the
  **constrained** form `sort xs where Ord a`, where `where Ord a` desugars to an
  implicit `{d : Ord a}` and the body's comparator is `d.leq` (`33 §5.4`)
- expect: **both emit the structurally identical refinement obligation**
  `isSorted (leq) ys ∧ Perm ys xs` (`34 §5`, with (b)'s `leq` ≡ `d.leq`) — the
  **same view**, one `sort`, the comparator either passed or
  dictionary-supplied. There is **no second `sort`** and **no
  distinct/duplicated obligation**
- why: (AC2) reflect-don't-extend — `where Ord a` is ordinary
  implicit-dictionary insertion supplying the comparator, **not** new mechanism.
  **Discriminating:** a build that introduces a **second `Ord`-sort** (a
  distinct view whose obligation differs from, or duplicates, the explicit
  form's) **fails** — the emitted VC must be the **same shape** as the explicit
  form's (modulo `leq = d.leq`). Assert the **observable**: the two emitted
  obligations are the **same structural shape**, not "both type-check".
  References the base `sort-emits-issorted-and-perm` (`../surface/collections/`)
  — the `Ord`-supplied form emits **that same** conjoined obligation, re-pinning
  nothing. (The named-non-canonical escape hatch `sortBy byLength xs`,
  `33 §5.5`, still passes a non-canonical `Ord` value explicitly — canonical
  resolution unperturbed.)

## Coverage map

- **AC3** (laws PROVED, soundness):
  `law-fields-real-proofs-not-postulates` (accept arm + postulate-defect
  **`(gated: K4)`**; holed/missing + declared-vs-hidden **live**),
  `primitive-carrier-declared-audited-delta` (carrier separation **`(gated:
  K4)`**; declared-vs-hidden **live**),
  `ord-total-law-is-omega-bool-equation`.
- **AC2** (`Ord` subsumes the comparator):
  `where-ord-same-sort-obligation`.
- **AC5** (un-defer): the two `../surface/collections/` cases
  (`user-ord-instance-drives-verified-sort`,
  `user-ord-sort-emits-both-conjuncts`) are re-pointed to the real `Ord` in
  `51`; they **un-defer on the build**, not here (edit made in
  `seed-collections.md`).

## Cross-case consistency sweep

- **Lawful ≡ zero-delta on an inductive carrier; audited-delta on a primitive
  one.** `law-fields-real-proofs-not-postulates` (an inductive carrier's
  postulated law → non-empty delta → **defect**) and the ES1
  `../surface/taxonomy/minimality.md` zero-delta invariant **agree**: on a
  **provable** (inductive) carrier nothing enters `trusted_base()` by the back
  door — a law proved-not-postulated is the law-side of zero-delta.
  `primitive-carrier-declared-audited-delta` completes it on the **carrier
  axis**: a primitive carrier's ∀-laws are **unprovable**, so its instance
  carries a **declared** audited delta (honest), not zero. The unifying rule: a
  delta is a **defect iff avoidable** (the carrier could have proved it) and
  an **honest audited-delta iff declared** (unprovable **and** visible). A case
  treating a primitive audited-delta as a defect (over-strict — you cannot lack
  `Ord Int`), an inductive-carrier postulate as lawful (under-strict — hides an
  avoidable delta), or a **hidden** primitive delta as honest, contradicts this
  class. **K4 staging:** the **avoidability** half (hence the carrier
  *separation* and inductive-postulate-defect verdict) is **`(gated: K4)`** —
  pre-K4 no carrier proves its laws, so **all** are audited-delta and the axis
  **collapses**; the **declaredness** half (honest iff declared) is
  **K4-independent and live today**.
- **A law field is `Ω` (proof-irrelevant).**
  `ord-total-law-is-omega-bool-equation` and the
  `51 §3` law-field-sort pin agree: every law field lands in `Ω` (the record is
  a `Type`-sorted structure class **because** of its op fields, never
  **because** a law leaked to `Type`). A case with a `Type`-valued "law" (a
  proof-relevant `∨` untruncated) would contradict the structure-class sort
  discipline.
- **`Ord`-supplied and explicit `sort` are one view.**
  `where-ord-same-sort-obligation` and the base
  `sort-emits-issorted-and-perm` agree: the emitted obligation is identical
  whether `leq` is passed or supplied by the dictionary. A case where the
  `where Ord a` form emits a **different** obligation (a second mechanism) would
  contradict reflect-don't-extend.

## Subsumed / not-duplicated (one home per property)

- **The `trusted_base()` / zero-delta mechanism** is **ES1/Sec4's**
  (`../surface/taxonomy/minimality.md`, `../../security/trust-model/`). AC3
  **reads it from the law side** (a postulated law → non-empty delta); it does
  **not** re-pin the delta computation.
- **The verified-`sort` refinement obligation** (`isSorted leq ys ∧ Perm ys xs`,
  the `Perm`-conjunct-present net) is **`../surface/collections/`'s**
  (`sort-emits-issorted-and-perm`). AC2 references it (the `Ord`-supplied form
  emits the same obligation); it does **not** re-pin the emission completeness.
- **The two `user-ord-*-sort` user-instance cases** are
  **`../surface/collections/`'s** (`user-ord-instance-drives-verified-sort`,
  `user-ord-sort-emits-both-conjuncts`), currently `(deferred)`. This WP is
  their un-defer gate (AC5): the edit re-points them to the real `Ord` in `51`;
  the actual un-defer (making them live) rides the build. Not re-homed here.
- **The class mechanism** (record elaboration, `sort_sigma`, `instance_search`,
  `where`-desugaring) is **`33 §5`'s** (surface). This seed pins the **lawful
  content** (the law proofs are real), not the resolution machinery.
