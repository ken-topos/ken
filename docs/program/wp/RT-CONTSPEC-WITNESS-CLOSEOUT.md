# RT-CONTSPEC-WITNESS closeout record

ContinuationSpecialization seam 4 of 4, the terminal seam. This document is the
`D5` closeout record and carries the `D1`-`D4` evidence it rests on.

**Base for every measurement in this document: `origin/main = 47ef28b1`**
(`47ef28b1c21a0ee192f029092c0c3c05636902b4`), the branch point of
`wp/RT-CONTSPEC-WITNESS`. Every count, verdict and disposition below was
measured on that tree unless a different SHA is named at the point of use.

**Citation convention.** Tests are named by module path and assertions by their
text, not by line number. A line coordinate is destroyed by the edit that the
deliverable describing it performs, and a stale one resolves plausibly against
unrelated live code; a name and a phrase survive. Where a number is
unavoidable it carries the SHA it was measured at.

## D1 - the native population on the lawful assembly

Both preconditions the frame carries from seams 1-3 were met in the same shell
as the run: the tree was proved immediately before the suite, and the build ran
before the test.

```
git rev-parse HEAD          -> 47ef28b1c21a0ee192f029092c0c3c05636902b4
scripts/ken-cargo build -p ken-runtime   -> Finished, 50 warnings
df -h /workspaces           -> 77G total, 11G available, 87% used
git rev-parse HEAD          -> 47ef28b1c21a0ee192f029092c0c3c05636902b4  (recheck)
scripts/ken-cargo test -p ken-runtime --lib
```

**Result: 809 passed, 0 failed, 4 ignored, 0 measured, 0 filtered out**,
finished in 59.35s.

The anchor was quoted twice in the one shell, before the build and again
immediately before the test, so the count is bound to that tree and not to a
tree the branch later moved to.

### The four ignored rows, named

An ignored test is not a passing test, and the aggregate line reports the two
separately for a reason. Naming them here keeps the `809` from being read as
"the whole population answered."

| ignored test | owner named in its own skip reason |
|---|---|
| `boundary_value_clif::tests::b2v_ac10_a_deep_acyclic_chain_adopts_at_thirty_thousand` | (depth/stack cost, not a census row) |
| `cranelift_backend::artifact::api::tests::nc22_cranelift_agrees_with_runtime_ir_report_for_broad_starter_shapes` | `RT-FNUNIT-RESULT-TOKEN` |
| `cranelift_backend::lowering::core::tests::constructors::c2_ac4_runtime_host_result_selects_a_separately_generated_nested_payload` | `RT-CARRIER-PRODUCER-OCCURRENCE` |
| `cranelift_backend::lowering::core::tests::constructors::two_same_shape_workers_are_distinguished` | `RT-WORKER-FIXTURE-DECODE` |

Two of these four are census rows, and they are the reason the disposition
table below does not read "130 pass, done". The third bears directly on `D7`
and is discussed there.

### Comparison with the held lineage, and what it is not

The census was taken at preservation `1aef3192` with the same targeted
command, and recorded **464 passed, 138 failed, 1 ignored**. The lawful base
runs **809 passed, 0 failed, 4 ignored**.

**These two numbers are not a before/after of one population and must not be
subtracted.** The suite grew by roughly 200 tests across the intervening
merges, the held lineage is a branch that was never merged, and no commit
takes one tree to the other. The comparison that is meaningful is per-row, and
it is the disposition table, not the totals.
