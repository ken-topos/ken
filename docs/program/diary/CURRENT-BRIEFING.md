**As of 2026-07-21 ~12:30Z. Operator is BACK and engaged.**

## Standing state

- Fleet is **SINGLE-THREADED**. Nothing is owed to any ring; every idle ring
  is **correct**, not a stall.
- `origin/main = 4a06cf90`. Nothing is blocked.
- **Do not kick a WP while the operator has an open question below.**

## Operator rulings — 2026-07-21 ~12:45Z. SETTLED, do not reopen.

**On Linux ABI II** (`research/linux-abi-ii-work-program-proposal.md`):

- **No "ratification."** The charter is a **planning document, not a
  commitment**. Nobody outside the project is watching, and nothing depends
  on our timelines or stated intentions. **I had imported a governance ritual
  that does not apply — do not re-raise status-correction as a decision.**
- **Where there is a gap between what was anticipated and what was done, fill
  the gap first.** Hence `docs/program/10-linux-abi-completion.md`.
- **L2-1: no cross-compilation. CROSS-PLATFORM IS INDEFINITELY DEFERRED**
  (restated by the operator 2026-07-21 after I re-raised it). A very late
  feature, behind a long line of other work. Manifest v2 = family-scoped and
  generated, **not** cross-target.

  ⛔ **This ruling ALREADY ANSWERS any non-linux finding — do not route one
  back as a scoping question.** I did exactly that with "`ken-host` has never
  compiled on any non-linux target" (28 `cfg(not(target_os = "linux"))`
  fail-closed sites, never built, `abi_v1.rs:747`). **Under this ruling that
  finding is inert**: the lane is deferred, nothing builds it, and the defect
  cannot bite. It is dead code for a deferred target, not an open decision.
  Record such findings as *observations against a deferred lane* and stop —
  a settled ruling is a fixed input, never a question to re-ask.
- **L2-0: all desirable, nothing deferred.** All nine
  `RepresentedUnavailable` operations get promoted.
- **Timing, timelines, and budget are the OPERATOR'S domain.** They monitor
  and adjust. **Do not reason about schedule or cost.**
- ★ **My lane is token efficiency in terms of delivered work.** That is the
  axis to optimize and the one to report on.

**Still genuinely open (lower stakes, no re-ask):**

- **Provider concentration** — only `runtime-implementer` and `adversary` are
  on the Anthropic pool.

**CI-TRACKER-GATE is RESOLVED.** The operator granted the app `workflows:
write`; verified present in the installation's permission set, and a
workflow-bearing push was accepted. Close the issue once PR #804 lands.

> ★ **Diagnosing a `workflows`-permission rejection.** A freshly minted token
> is NOT enough — but neither is assuming staleness. `mint-gh-token.sh` with

## The completion program — written, NOT started

`docs/program/10-linux-abi-completion.md` (commit `f2b98c37`, unpublished).
Five tracks — **R** reconcile, **A** availability promotion, **M** manifest
(native-target only), **S** synchronous floor, **T** the committed exit
(PX10/PX11/PX12).

Verified against `main`, not taken from the advisory: 22 ops, 13
`NativeTested` / 9 `RepresentedUnavailable`, no process/socket/poll family in
any state, PX7 landed — and **PX9 (cross-domain `System.Error`) is chartered
but undelivered**, which the advisory's "good filesystem floor" phrasing
obscured. PX9 gates most of Track T.

**Not started.** Next step when the operator says go: decompose the tracks
into `docs/program/issues/` entries.

## ✅ TRACK Q IS COMPLETE — nothing outstanding (2026-07-21 ~21:55Z)

**Q-RESIDUE merged: `origin/main @ 64337192` (PR #818)**, from
`wp/Q-RESIDUE-test-rework @ 3f752451`. Verified on main **by content** (the
crate diff against the approved SHA is empty), not by the publisher's exit
code. Issue closed, all three retros in, adversary notified
(`evt_4g7qasxqdy5s8`). Q1 and Q2 merged earlier the same day.

**The fleet is idle and home-clean, and that is CORRECT** — the queue below
is unstarted pending the operator's direction. Do not kick any of it
without their go.

## ✅ TRACK Q — DONE (2026-07-21). Only Q-RESIDUE remains, and it is an S.

**Q1 landed. Q2 complete: 428 triaged, 100% classified, six rings in
parallel.** Result: `docs/program/qa-triage/FINDINGS.md`.

| class | count | share |
|---|---:|---:|
| durable-invariant | 392 | **91.6%** |
| compat-vector | 19 | 4.4% |
| transition-sentinel | 7 | 1.6% |
| UNCLASSIFIABLE | 10 | 2.3% |

**Q3–Q7 folded by the operator into ONE S** — `docs/program/issues/Q-RESIDUE.md`
(status `ready`, owner `runtime`). **Not kicked; awaiting operator go.**

## ▶ THE DOC PROGRAM IS RUNNING — a SECOND, CONCURRENT track (2026-07-21 ~22:5xZ)

`origin/main @ 7610d2a1`. **`DOC-W0` is `active`** and released to a new
**doc team** (`evt_1m7j5qvvm2p2m`). This is the fleet's **one standing
exception to single-threading** (operator): the doc track runs **concurrently**
with build work, because doc WPs touch `library/` and `agent/`, not `crates/`.
**The exception is contention-free-ness, not priority** — a doc WP that would
touch a path a build WP holds defers.

| seat | tier | agent id |
|---|---|---|
| `doc-leader` | T2 Sonnet 5 | `agt_37w6sznc4nw00` |
| `doc-author` | T2 Sonnet 5 | `agt_37w6t02849400` |
| `librarian` | **T1 `gpt-5.6-sol`** | (existing) — the team's **QA** |

**★ Judgment is concentrated on the REVIEWING end, not the authoring end** —
inverted from every other team, deliberately. Documentation fails by being
*confidently wrong*, not badly written; a page whose citation does not carry
its claim reads perfectly. That is a grounding problem, which is where T1 pays.

Frame: `docs/program/12-documentation-program.md` (§0 team, §1 four **settled**
decisions — do not reopen). Overlays: `agent/teams/doc/{leader,implementer}.md`.
There is **no `doc-qa` seat** and no `agent/teams/doc/qa.md`.

**Seat provisioning, if it ever needs repeating:** `moot init` is NOT usable —
its only incremental option is `--force`, which rotates keys for **all**
already-adopted agents and would kill every live seat. Use the API directly:
`POST /api/agents` → `POST /api/registration-tickets/{id}/exchange` for the
plaintext key → write into `.moot/actors.json` (gitignored). PAT is at
`.mootup/credentials`. OAS: `local/refs/convo/docs/api/openapi.yaml`
(operator-sanctioned read; clean-room bars `local/refs/` for *writing Ken's
code*, which this is not).

## My queue, in order

0. **BUDGET-EFF** — Handoff Gate the Spec enclave (spec-leader, spec-author,
   conformance-validator). **Spec erratum FIRST**: `38` self-contradicts
   (`:404-405`/`:443-444` say *effective*, `:419-420`/`:438-440` say
   *requested*), so a code-first fix re-derives the defect from a broken
   citation. It is a **plumbing gap, not a formula fix** —
   `TransferCountV1::new(read, effective)` validates then **discards**
   `effective`, so neither reifier can compute the bound. Two closures with
   different blast radii ⇒ **Architect call**. Oracle
   ⛔ **AC-3 REWRITTEN — my earlier pin was VOID.** The R1 oracle's conclusion
   compares two values computed from its OWN constants (`RAW-count` vs
   `effective-count` = `4 == 0`) and **never reads a reifier field**, so it
   fails on ANY implementation and its failure at `e892777c` confirmed
   nothing. "Must pass unchanged" is **withdrawn**; the oracle must be
   **rewritten to observe the mechanism**. ⛔ **"Confirmed by execution" was
   also FALSE** — the defect rests on **source inspection** of the two
   reifiers. ★ **An adversary repro demonstrates a defect; a completion oracle
   defines correctness. Pinning does not convert one into the other — verify
   an oracle observes the mechanism BEFORE making it an AC.** Detail:
   `docs/program/wp/BUDGET-EFF-remaining-bounded-by-effective-request.md`
2. **SEAL-2** — re-anchor on current `main`; evidence
   `adversary/SEAL2-repros@70a603da`.
3. Then STR-BIJ → enclave (`ready`, S) · F1 → Architect (`ready`) · F3 ·
   A3 · F4 · RT-SPLIT (**L**, 22k-line `cranelift_backend.rs`).

**Readiness is thin behind BUDGET-EFF — only two items are releasable.**
STR-BIJ (`ready`, enclave) and F1 (`ready`, runtime → Architect first).
The rest are `draft`; **A3 has no owner, no size, and no brief** and blocks
F4. ⚠ Verify "no brief" claims by *reading `docs/program/wp/`*, not by
globbing on the ID — the F3 brief is `F2F3-reducer-degrade.md` (it covers F2
and F3 together) and I mis-reported it as missing once already.

## In flight

**`DOC-W0` — doc team, active.** Nothing else. Branch aligned on
`origin/main`, clean, no orphaned polls. Build fleet idle and home-clean,
which is **correct**, not a stall.

**Also queued, not started: `Q-CLAIM-CLOSURE`** (`issues/Q-CLAIM-CLOSURE.md`,
`ready`, owner runtime) — the adversary's post-merge findings on Q-RESIDUE.
Advisory, **no live defects**. Its generator is worth reading before framing
any future rework WP: *the ACs took the TEST as the unit when the load-bearing
unit was the CLAIM*, so a rework could strengthen one claim, mutation-prove it,
and silently drop its siblings while fully satisfying the criteria. R1 (ABI
fact inventory has no independent anchor — both sides of the check come from
one generator) is the one to sequence first.

**CLOSED — not a scoping question.** `ken-host` has never compiled on any
non-linux target (`abi_v1.rs:747`, `?` on an `Option` in a `Result`-returning
fn; pre-existing since PX5 `049628f8`, adversary confirmed by extracting and
compiling it). 28 `cfg(not(target_os = "linux"))` fail-closed sites, never
built. **Cross-platform is indefinitely deferred (operator) — so this is dead
code for a deferred lane and cannot bite.** Recorded as an observation; no
action, no decision pending. See the L2-1 ruling above.

Recently landed and verified by content: **#818** (Q-RESIDUE), **#819**
(Track Q closeout), **#820** (doc program frame), **#821** (doc team),
**#822** (librarian T1 + DOC-W0 release).

## ⚠ FLEET IS MID-RESEAT — leader / implementer / QA seats → Sonnet 5

The operator is reseating the build-team seats (**not** spec-leader). Seats
were cycling as of ~19:00Z.

> ### ★ NEW TRAP — a reseated agent re-posts an ALREADY-CLOSED retro
>
> `kernel-leader` came up on a fresh seat and posted a §10 retro for
> **KTR-1, which closed 2026-07-14 with retros already in** (`65d68cfc`,

> But **counting such a re-post inflates the promotion ladder.**
>

> actionable: its retros were genuinely in and only the frontmatter lagged at

**Do not kick any WP until the reseat is complete and the operator releases
one.** Delivering into a seat that is about to restart is the transport
failure the Handoff Gate exists to prevent.

## Programs written, NOT started

- `docs/program/10-linux-abi-completion.md` — the work Linux ABI II presumes.
  Tracks R/A/M/S/T; **PX9 gates most of Track T**.
- `docs/program/11-test-suite-and-ci-remediation.md` — **Track C is DONE.
  CI went 47 min -> ~8 min, landed `8b09fb95`.** Skip the three slow native
  binaries + nextest + shard x4 + `opt-level = 2` on deps + rust-cache
  removed. **Do not shard further** — per-shard parallelism already fell
  3.96x -> 2.5x, so 8 shards would buy ~90s for double the compute. The next
  real reduction must come from `CI-SKIPPED-NATIVE-TESTS` getting faster.
  Details and full scorecard in §1a/§1b. **Track Q (the QA-advisory sweep)
  is untouched and still the actual point of the program.**

  **Skipped-test restoration — measured, not guessed** (§1c/§1d,
  `CI-SKIPPED-NATIVE-TESTS`). Any job finishing under the ~471s critical
  shard costs **zero** wall clock, and that headroom is the budget:
  - `px8f_write_partition` ✅ restored, own `native-slow` job. **C6 gave it
    −22.7%** (309s→239s) vs 8.4% suite-wide — C6's benefit is concentrated
    in cranelift-heavy code, exactly as predicted.
  - `px8f_buffer_native` ✅ restored, own `native-buffer` job. **Measured on
    run 29850680007: Test step 149s, job 224s** — well under the 482s
    critical shard, so it costs zero wall clock, as predicted.
  - `rt_parity_native` — **a ONE-TEST problem.** Parallelizes fine (7 tests,
    266.7s wall / 470.6s CPU), but
    `fs_write_at_malformed_offset_narrows_to_invalid_offset` takes **221.4s**
    vs **42.2s** for its near-identical sibling. Fix that one and the binary
    lands ~90s. **Do not just re-enable it** — today it fits by ~1s, which
    is noise.

  ✅ **Dedicated jobs are now scoped** (`-p <crate> --test <name>`), not
  `--workspace` — that was compiling all 200 test binaries to run one. Now
  **confirmed by isolation**: `px8f_write_partition`'s Test step went
  **241s → 129s (−112s)** across runs 29850405231 → 29850680007 with
  scoping as the only variable, against a ~124s estimate. The `Build` step
  stays `--workspace`: it is only ~65s and it is what proves the workspace
  compiles under `--locked`.

  **Only `rt_parity_native` is still skipped, and the target is ONE test.**

  Measured distribution: `cargo test` walks its **200 test binaries strictly
  in series**, and **three of them — nine tests — are 56.5% of the whole
  run** (`rt_parity_native` 14m41s, `px8f_buffer_native` 5m10s in a *single*
  test, `px8f_write_partition` 5m09s in a *single* test). The bottom 150
  binaries total **48 seconds**. All three fat binaries do a real native
  codegen-and-link per test case.

  **Next steps are C2 → C6 → C7, re-measuring between each:** nextest (one
  global pool replaces the serial walk), `[profile.dev.package."*"]
  opt-level = 2` (cranelift runs its codegen unoptimized — **hypothesis,
  test it in CI, do not merge on plausibility**), and splitting the two
  1-test binaries (unsubdividable, so they become the critical path the
  moment C2 lands). C1 landed and bought ~5s — **do not report it as a
  throughput win**.

  ⚠ C7 and Q7 are one edit from two sides — splitting the native binaries
  for parallelism, and giving temp dirs per-test ownership so that
  parallelism is safe. Do them together or expect a flake that reads as
  "nextest broke the suite."

  **`scripts/ci-test-timings.sh <run-id>`** regenerates the per-binary table
  from any run's log. Granularity is the binary; per-`#[test]` needs C2.

Next step for either program when the operator says go: decompose its tracks
into `docs/program/issues/` entries.

- ⛔⛔ **AFTER EVERY MERGE, RE-BASE `steward/work` ONTO `main` BEFORE THE
  NEXT COMMIT.** Cost three publish cycles on 2026-07-21 — the same trap
  each time. `main` merges are **squash** merges, so `steward/work` never
  contains the resulting commit: its merge base stays at the *previous*
  main, and GitHub's three-way merge then conflicts on any file both sides
  touched, even when the content is compatible.

  > ★ **`git diff origin/main..HEAD` will NOT warn you.** A two-dot diff
  > shows the **net difference**; a merge asks a **different question** —
  > what happens when both sides' changes are replayed from a shared base.
  > A clean two-dot diff next to a conflicting merge is not a contradiction.
  > **The check that actually predicts a conflict is**
  > `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main HEAD` — if that fails, rebase
  > *before* committing anything further.

  Recipe (content-preserving, verified three times):
  `git tag -f preserved/<sha> HEAD` → `git reset --hard origin/main` →
  `git checkout <old-sha> -- <changed files>` → regenerate the dashboard →
  commit. Then confirm with `git diff <old-sha> HEAD`: the **only** expected
  delta is `IMPLEMENTATION-PROGRESS.md`'s timestamp line.
  ⚠ Do **not** verify with a bare `git diff` after `git checkout -- <path>`
  — that stages the files, so unstaged `git diff` reads empty and looks like
  a mismatch. Compare **commit to commit**.

- ⛔ **`scripts/scripted-pr-automerge.sh` exits 0 on failure** (4 times on
  2026-07-21). Its **first attempt after any merge always fails** with
  `stale info`, because the merge deletes the origin head branch and stales
  the local ref. **Always `git fetch origin --prune` before publishing.**
  ⚠ Its `--description-file` must exist **before** the call — a heredoc
  inside the same `&&` chain does not reliably land, and the script reports
  `description file not found` and exits.
  Redirect its output to a file — a `| tail` pipe block-buffers it to 0
  bytes. Afterwards it sleeps ~40 min polling a PR that may already have
  merged; verify `origin/main` by content and kill the orphan. Tracked as
  issue `PUB-VERIFY`.
- **A piped exit code belongs to the last command in the pipeline**, not to
  `git`. Verify `HEAD` moved.
- **Branch-ahead ⇏ unmerged** (squash-merge trap). Verify by content.
- **Concurrent subagents in one worktree share `.git`** — path-disjoint is
  **not** commit-disjoint. Two raced the index on 2026-07-21. Use
  `isolation: "worktree"`.
- **`convo` posting can fail while the channel stays up.** An absent post is
  not a stalled agent — check the pane.
- **A literal-string grep is a proxy, not the property.** "Four tools" had
  been upgraded to "Five tools"; the grep read as content loss and nearly
  discarded good work. Grep the theme, then read the hit.
- Liveness: `tmux capture-pane -p -S -300 -t moot-<seat>` — **`-S` must be
  negative**; a positive value returns ~1 line and reads every seat as dead.
- `Press up to edit queued messages` = **busy + queued. Do not resend.**

## Standing discipline

A success signal says a thing **ran**, never that it did what you meant —
**verify by content**. `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` must read
`steward/work` before any write. Local builds are **targeted only** via
`scripts/ken-cargo -p <crate>` — **never `--workspace`** (it OOMs the box).
Workspace-green means green in **CI**.
