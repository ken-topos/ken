title: "lawful JSON codec — the data-structures tier's acceptance test: a Json value type, encode/decode, and the proved round-trip law, assembled entirely from the landed Core/Data sections"
status: draft
owner: foundation
size: L
gate: none
depends_on: []
blocks: []
github: null
origin: Phase 3 of the catalog data-structures enrichment program (docs/program/wp/catalog-data-structures-program.md), under the catalog campaign charter (docs/program/06-catalog-campaign.md), which homes catalog authoring in Foundation. Steward-filed; Steward owns the frame and AC/control placement. Carrier design fork put to the Architect as evt_46z6m4mcpdbj4 — the node stays draft until that ruling is transcribed into frame §3.

## Why this node is `draft` and not `ready`

⛔ **One Architect ruling is outstanding.** Frame §3 holds a transcription slot
for it, and the node flips `ready` only once the ruling is written into that
slot. An in-thread ruling is not a durable input.

**The fork** (put as `evt_46z6m4mcpdbj4`): DS-9's central deliverable is a
**proved** round-trip law, and reasoning through a `Bytes` encoder appears to
stop. Measured at `origin/main = 32b1b772`:

| measurement | where |
|---|---|
| `bytes_concat` occurs **zero times in the entire `spec/` tree** — no chapter, no registry row, no law | `spec/` (whole-tree grep) |
| `bytes_to_list : Bytes → List UInt8` is `PrimReduction::Op`, **"opaque to kernel conversion"** | `spec/10-kernel/18a-primitive-registry.md:624` |
| its bridge laws `bytes_list_roundtrip` / `list_bytes_roundtrip` are **"trusted declarations, not"** proofs | `:628-629` |

⇒ A `Json → Bytes` encoder makes the round-trip either unprovable or provable
only at a `trusted_base()` cost — against the zero-delta discipline every landed
catalog entry has held. The carrier is a component-design call, so it is the
Architect's, not mine.

⚠ `bytes_encode`/`bytes_decode` are **not** in the same position — the
`BytesRoundTripLaw` at `spec/30-surface/38-ffi-io.md:253` records
`∀ s. bytes_decode (bytes_encode s) == Ok s` as **provable**. The gap is `Bytes`
*concatenation*, not the `String`/`Bytes` boundary.

## ⛔ The `DS-5 → DS-9` graph edge is CUT

The program's Mermaid graph draws `DS5[DS-5 Vector] --> DS9`. **DS-5 is
spec-gated** on a `spec/50-stdlib/` `Vector` chapter that has no author and no
node, and its own program text lists it under "Deferred / prerequisites."

⇒ Honoring that edge would park the tier's acceptance test behind a spec gap it
has no need of. DS-9 uses `List`, complete since DS-4. `depends_on` is therefore
empty: every real prerequisite is already **merged**.

## What the tier supplies

DS-1 `Empty`/`Dec` · DS-2 `Ord Nat` · DS-3 `Option`/`Result` combinators ·
DS-4 `List` combinators + laws · DS-6 lawful `DecEq Char` → `Eq`/`Ord String` ·
DS-7 `Applicative`/`Monad` · DS-8 `Traversable` · plus the parsing floor
(`Capability/Parsing/{Cursor,Decoder,Numeric,Parsing}.ken.md`), which is
carrier-neutral by construction and already recursion-capable.

⭐ **The exemplar stops exactly where DS-9 must not.**
`Capability/Parsing/Parsing.ken.md` §4.3 builds a recursive `BoolExpr` grammar
with both a parser and a printer — and **no round-trip theorem**. Its complete
theorem list is three items, none of them about printing. So the exemplar gives
DS-9 its shape and not its proof, and the proof is the work.

## Findings are a deliverable, not a byproduct

Per the charter's routing: kernel-reduction defect → **Kernel** via the enclave;
sugar or abstraction candidate → **Ergo**; abstraction kept in-catalog →
Foundation. ⛔ A DS-9 that lands clean and files nothing has written a codec
without running the acceptance test. `AC-10` exists so that "clean" and "never
looked" cannot read identically.

## Contention

**None with Runtime.** DS-9 touches `catalog/packages/` and adds one file under
`crates/ken-elaborator/tests/`. Runtime's queue — `ABI-S3` → `RT-VALUE-TOTALITY`
P2 → `RT-FNSPLIT-C1` — is confined to `crates/ken-host`, `crates/ken-runtime`,
`crates/ken-interp`, and `crates/ken-elaborator/src`. ⚠ Frame §7 carries the
one caveat worth re-checking at branch time.
